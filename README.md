# RL-Project
My personal exploration into using reinforcement learning for algorithm development and data structure construction.

## The Plan
### Step 1: Searching
- Research reinforcement learning by reading textbooks and watching youtube videos to get foundational knowledge
- Train a reinforcement learning model to binary search a sorted list

### Step 2: Sorting
- Use the information in [Google's AlphaDev model](https://www.deepmind.com/blog/alphadev-discovers-faster-sorting-algorithms) to train a model to sort

### Step 3: Create Balanced Binary Tree
- Use the framework from [IEEE](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9658790) to model tree operations
- Train a reinforcement learning model to create a form of balanced binary tree

### Step 4: BVH Tree Construction
- Using the results of the previous step, train a model to optimize the construction of a common data structure in ray tracing, the [BVH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bounding_volume_hierarchy) in an attempt to create high quality trees relatively quickly.
